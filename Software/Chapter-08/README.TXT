The Visual Studio solutions were created with Visual Studio 2005, with all code tested against SQL Server 2008.

Support files, such as XML source data files, XSD schema files, DTDs, and text files are located in the Support directory.  You may need to copy these files to other locations to run the samples, as specified in the book and in the code itself.

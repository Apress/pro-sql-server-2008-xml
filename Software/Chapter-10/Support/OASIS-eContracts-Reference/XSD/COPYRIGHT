# serves two purposes:
#
#          (a) it contains statements to include the other files that 
#              provide element definitions for all elements found in  
#              the eContracts schema. 
#
#          (b) it can be used to make customizations to the eContracts 
#              schema by changing the content patterns that are defined 
#              in the other schema files.
